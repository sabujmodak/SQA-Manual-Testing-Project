# SQA-Manual-Testing-Project

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to SQA manual testing, including a detailed explanation of the process, best practices, and a sample test case.

# Introduction
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) manual testing is a critical component of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It involves manually executing test cases to identify and report software defects. Manual testing is an essential part of the SQA process because it helps to ensure that software meets its functional and non-functional requirements.

# Benefits of SQA Manual Testing

# There are many benefits to SQA manual testing, including:

    Early defect detection: Manual testing can help to identify defects early in the development process, when they are easier and less expensive to fix.
    Thorough testing: Manual testers can explore software in more detail than automated test scripts, which can help to identify more obscure defects.
    Creative testing: Manual testers can use their creativity to come up with new test cases that may not be possible to automate.
